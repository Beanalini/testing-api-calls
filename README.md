# Testing API Calls in React With the Star Wars API

## Description

This project creates an App from scratch using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that makes a Get request to the Star Wars [Swapi](https://swapi.dev/) endpoint and displays the title of the first person returned from the API endpoint. The main aim of this projects is to create a mock server and test that the data being returned is rendered correctly.

## Project Requirements

- Create a React app
- Make the React app call the Star Wars API people end point and display the first person on the page.
- Add msw to mock (or "stub") the API response.
- Use a mock server to write a test to check the first person that the mock server returns is being correctly rendered to the page.
- Write a test that checks your component displays an error message saying "Oops... something went wrong, try again ðŸ¤•" if the API returns Status Code 500 (Internal Server Error: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500 ).
- Write another test checking your component displays an error message saying "418 I'm a tea pot ðŸ«–, silly" in the scenario of the API returning Status Code 418 (Iâ€™m a tea pot: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418 )
